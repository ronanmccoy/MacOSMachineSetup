# MacOS Machine Setup

## Intro

A set of scripts for setting up a new mac for dev work. This is specifically for a base setup as there certainly are additional configurations and software that a developer might need. Note that this includes themes that are specific to my liking. And what I like, might not be what you like!

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal on your machine and `cd` to the directory where this has been cloned to
3. From the terminal run
   - `sh mac_setup.sh`
   - `sh git_setup.sh`
